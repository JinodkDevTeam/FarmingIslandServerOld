## Q&A
### How to add protocols into the config?
You will find out that accept.yml looks like this:
```yml
---
accept-protocol: []
...
```
What you need to do is to transform it to this:
```yml
---
accept-protocol:
- protocol
- anotherprotocol
...
```
### Where i can find the protocols i need?
1. Go to [this link](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Protocol_version)
2. Go to Bedrock Edition section
3. Here you have all Bedrock Edition protocols, so enjoy! ;)
